# Godot SDL Gyro
GDextention that allows to read Gyro from a controller in Godot 4, it utilizes SDL and JibbSmart [GamepadMotionHelpers](https://github.com/JibbSmart/GamepadMotionHelpers) libraries
## Usage
Download the latest build from the [Releases](https://github.com/SagaPDev/Godot-SDL-Gyro/releases/latest) tab Extract the addons folder and place it in the root of your project

in your GDscript make a new SDLGyro object
~~~
...
var Gyro=SDLGyro.new()
...
~~~
initialize SDL and The controller ready function
~~~
...
func _ready():
  Gyro.sdl_init()
  Gyro.controller_init()
...
~~~
call  any of the folloing functions in the process fuction
~~~
      gamepad_polling()            //returns controller orientation (this function needs to be called so that the others can work)

      calibrate()                //starts continous calibrations
      stop_calibrate()           //stops continius calibration
     
      get_player_space()          //not working
      get_world_space()           //not working
      get_gravity()               //not working
  
      get_calibrated_gyro()       //retutns the controller's angular velocity in degrees per second
      get_processed_acceleration() //returns the controller's current acceleration in g-force with gravity removed
~~~
